# Stage 1: Dependencies Installation Stage
# ============================================

# IMPORTANT: Node.js Version Maintenance
# This Dockerfile defaults to Node.js 24.14.1-slim to match the repo's Node 24 baseline.
# To ensure security and compatibility, update the NODE_VERSION ARG when the project's Node baseline changes.
ARG NODE_VERSION=24.14.1-slim

# Bun is the package manager (root package.json `packageManager`). Pull the static
# bun binary from the official image; keep the node base for the Next.js runtime.

# Set working directory

# Copy the workspace manifests first to leverage Docker's caching mechanism.
# Per-package package.json files are needed so `bun install` resolves workspaces.

# Build Next.js application
# If you want to speed up Docker rebuilds, you can cache the build artifacts
# by adding: --mount=type=cache,target=/app/.next/cache
# This caches the .next/cache directory across builds, but it also prevents
# .next/cache/fetch-cache from being included in the final image, meaning
# cached fetch responses from the build won't be available at runtime.
