# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments and conversation history append under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory if needed.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the referenced file. The user will normally provide its path or issue number.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `wayfinder`. A map has one child file per ticket.

- Map: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`
- Child ticket: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`
- `Type:` records `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`
- `Status:` records `claimed` or `resolved`
- `Blocked by: NN, NN` lists dependencies
- To find the frontier, scan for open, unblocked, and unclaimed tickets; lowest number wins
- To claim, set `Status: claimed` before beginning work
- To resolve, append the answer under `## Answer`, set `Status: resolved`, and add a context pointer to the map
